// I have successfully deployed on both Netlify and Heroku, but I'm experiencing a connection issue. When I open my link within the Netlify site, it works, but when accessing the URL directly from outside Netlify or pasting it into the browser, I get a 404 error. I will try to fix this as quickly as possible, but for now, I will leave screenshots showing the successful deployment on Netlify and Heroku.
